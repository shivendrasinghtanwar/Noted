# Noted!
Fast, Simple and Cross Platform Notes taking app with some additional features!

## Setting Up Deveopent Environment

Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

After installing check your version of -

node 

    node -v
    
npm

    npm -v
    
The verions I am using are - node(v8.14.0) and npm(6.4.1)

Clone the repo - Duh!

    git clone https://github.com/shivendrasinghtanwar/Noted.git

Move to the project folder!

    cd wherever/you/cloned/this

Initialize node modules
    
    npm install
    
This is will install all the project dependencies 

As I have listed electron js as one of them you will not need to install it explicity

## Running the App

This process is bound to change real soon.

In your project folder type

    npm run node
    
This will start the node server

Open another terminal tab and move to the project directory again and type

    npm start
    
This will start the app. Now Have Fun! :)
